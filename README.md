# image-and-pdf-size-compression
This project focuses on developing a GUI-based Image and PDF Compression Tool using Python. The application efficiently reduces the file size of images and PDF documents while maintaining their quality, making it ideal for storage optimization and faster file sharing.

The tool is built using CustomTkinter for the graphical user interface, PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image compression, and pikepdf for PDF optimization. The interface allows users to easily select files, preview them, and compress them with just a few clicks.

The system ensures minimal loss in image clarity and PDF readability through adjustable compression levels. It supports multiple file formats (e.g., JPG, PNG, and PDF) and provides output with significant size reduction.

This project demonstrates strong practical understanding of Python programming, file handling, and GUI application development, while showcasing the ability to integrate multiple libraries into a seamless, user-friendly software solution.
